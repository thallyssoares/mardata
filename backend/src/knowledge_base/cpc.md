# Cost Per Click (CPC)

CPC is the price you pay for each click in your pay-per-click (PPC) marketing campaigns. It is a critical metric for understanding the cost-efficiency of your ads.

**Formula:** CPC = (Cost of Ad Campaign / Number of Clicks)

A lower CPC is generally better, as it means you are paying less to get a potential customer to your website. However, a very low CPC might also indicate low-quality traffic.
