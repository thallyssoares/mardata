# Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

ROAS is a marketing metric that measures the amount of revenue your business earns for each dollar it spends on advertising. 

**Formula:** ROAS = (Revenue from Ad Campaign / Cost of Ad Campaign)

A high ROAS indicates a successful and efficient ad campaign. A common benchmark is a 4:1 ratio ($4 in revenue for every $1 spent).
